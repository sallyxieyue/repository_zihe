1. Analysis

```{r,include=FALSE}
df <- read.table("data.txt", header = TRUE)
```

There were `r nrow(df)` data observation in the study.

2. Table
```{r,include=FALSE}
library(survminer)
library(survival)
km_model <- survfit(Surv(time, DEATH_EVENT) ~1, data = df)
table <- summary(km_model, times = seq(from = 0, to = 290, by = 30))
outputtab <- cbind(table$time,table$n.risk,table$n.event,round(table$surv,3),round(table$cumhaz,3))
rownames(outputtab) <- NULL
colnames(outputtab) <- c("Time","Risk Set","Number of Event","Survival","Hazard")

```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
outputtab
```

From the table we could see the overall survival probability and cumulative hazard ratio.

2. Plot

![Figure 1](fig1.png)

From the plot we could see that the survival curves between smokers and non-smokers are quite similar. And the p-value indicate that there is no significant difference of survival probabilities within two groups.
